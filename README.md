Abstract
--------

This is a [Node](http://nodejs.org/) Application Programming Interface
(API), Command-Line Interface (CLI) and Grunt Task for inlining all
external assets of HTML/CSS files. The purpose of this approach is
to either reduce the number of required HTTP requests for HTML5
Single-Page-Apps (SPA) or to simply bundle a stand-alone HTML document
with all its external assets for easier distribution.

Installation
------------

Use the Node Package Manager (NPM) to install this module
locally (default) or globally (with option `-g`):

    $ npm install [-g] inline-assets
